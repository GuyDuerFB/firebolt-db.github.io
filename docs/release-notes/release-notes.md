# Release notes

Firebolt continuously releases updates so that you can benefit from the latest and most stable service. These updates might happen daily, but we aggregate release notes to cover a longer time period for easier reference. The most recent release notes from the latest version are below. 

- See the [Release notes archive](../release-notes/release-notes-archive.md) for earlier-version release notes.

## DB version 3.32
**April 2024**

* [Enhancements, changes, and new integrations](#enhancements-changes-and-new-integrations)

### Enhancements, changes and new integrations

<!--- FIR-31191 --->**New Identifier Rules for Table Expression Query**

In order to prevent table expression query failure, new structure for naming conventions have been added. The first character of an identifier must now be either a letter (a-z) or an underscore (_). After the initial character, identifiers can include letters, underscores, or digits (0-9). 

<!--- FIR-25079 --->**Spilling Aggregations**

Firebolt can now process most aggregations that exceed the available main memory of the engine by spilling to the SSD cache when needed. This happens transparently to the user. A query that made use of this capability will populate the `spilled_bytes` column in `information_schema.query_history`. Spilling does not support aggregations where a single group exceeds the available memory (e.g., `select count(distinct high_cardinality_column) from huge_table`) and may not yet work reliably for all aggregate functions or engine specs. We will continue improving the feature in upcoming releases.

<!--- FIR-30398 --->**Align the syntax of our "escape" string literals with PostgreSQL**

Escape [string literals](../general-reference/data-types.md) now support octal and Unicode escape sequences. As a result, escape string literals now behave exactly like PostgreSQL. Example: `SELECT E'\U0001F525b\x6F\154t';` returns `🔥bolt`. If the setting `standard_conforming_strings` is not enabled for you, regular string literals (e.g., `SELECT 'foo';`) will also recognize the new escape sequences. However, we recommend exclusively using escape string literals for using escape sequences. Please be aware that you will get different results if you previously used (escape) string literals containing the syntax we now use for Unicode and octal escape sequences.

<!--- FIR-29729 --->**Remove old deprecate REGENERATE AGGREGATING INDEX**

 `REGENERATE AGGREGATING INDEX` syntax has been removed.
